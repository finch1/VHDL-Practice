LICENSEE shall keep all records of account as are necessary to demonstrate compliance with its obligations under this Exhibit A, including without limitation with respect to determination of the ASIC Project Royalties, for a period of five (5) years from the date of each royalty report.  ALTERA shall have the right, upon two (2) business days advance notice to LICENSEE to inspect, or have inspected by independent auditors or accountants ("Auditors"), LICENSEE’s books, records, and other documentation (including computer files) during normal business hours to determine whether LICENSEE is complying with these ASIC Project License Terms and to determine the accuracy of amounts due under the ASIC Project Per Unit Royalties Option, if elected.  Any report issued by ALTERA or the Auditors as to amounts due under the ASIC Project Per Unit Royalties Option shall (in the absence of clerical or manifest error) be final and binding on the parties. Such audit shall be at ALTERA’s 
expense unless it reveals an underpayment of the amounts due under the ASIC Project Per Unit Royalties Option subject to audit of five per cent (5%) or more, in which case LICENSEE shall reimburse ALTERA for the costs of such audit.  Any underpayment or underpayment of royalties shall be promptly corrected.

Upon any termination of this Agreement, YOU must destroy the MegaCore Function, including all copies and portions thereof in any form (whether or not merged into an Authorized ASIC or incorporated into an End Product), and certify the same to ALTERA upon request except that LICENSEE’S customers may continue to use End Products (incorporating Authorized ASICs which have been developed in accordance with this Agreement) which have been shipped prior to the termination.

A-11	Survival.  In the event of termination of the Agreement for any reason, the rights, obligations, and restrictions under Sections A-1, A-2, A-5, A-7, A-8, A-9, A-10 and A-11 of this Exhibit A shall survive termination of this Agreement.
